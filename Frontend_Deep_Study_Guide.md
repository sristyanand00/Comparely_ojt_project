## 1. React Fundamentals

### What is React?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you create reusable UI components that update efficiently when your data changes. React is declarative, component-based, and uses a virtual DOM for fast updates.

**In this project:**
- All UI is built using React function components (e.g., `LandingPage.jsx`, `ComparelyDashboard.jsx`).
- Components are organized in the `src/Components/` folder.

**If React was missing:**
- You would have to write all UI updates manually with vanilla JS, which is much harder to maintain and scale.

**Why important:**
- React makes it easy to build complex, interactive UIs by breaking them into small, reusable pieces.

**Common Interview Q:**
- Q: What is a React component?
- A: A reusable, self-contained piece of UI, usually written as a function that returns JSX.

### Components
- **What:** Functions that return JSX (HTML-like syntax). Can have their own state and props.
- **In this project:** Every page and UI piece is a component (e.g., `LandingPage`, `AuthPage`, `ProfilePage`).
- **If missing:** No modularity; code would be messy and hard to maintain.
- **Why important:** Encourages reusability and separation of concerns.

**Example from `LandingPage.jsx`:**
```js
function LandingPage() {
  // ...
  return (
    <div className="landing-container"> ... </div>
  );
}
```

### Props
- **What:** Data passed from parent to child components.
- **In this project:** Used to pass data like `user` to `LandingPage`, or `title` and `image` to `CategoryCard`.
- **If missing:** Components couldn't be customized or reused with different data.
- **Why important:** Enables dynamic, flexible UIs.

**Example:**
```js
<CategoryCard title={cat.title} image={cat.image} />
```

### State
- **What:** Data that changes over time within a component.
- **In this project:** Used for things like search input, user info, product lists, modal visibility, etc.
- **If missing:** UI couldn't update in response to user actions or data changes.
- **Why important:** Makes components interactive and dynamic.

**Example from `ComparelyDashboard.jsx`:**
```js
const [search, setSearch] = useState("");
```

### Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- **What:** Special functions for using state and side effects in function components.
- **In this project:**
  - `useState` for managing local state (e.g., search, user, products)
  - `useEffect` for running code on mount (e.g., fetching products)
- **If missing:** Would have to use class components and lifecycle methods, which are more complex.
- **Why important:** Simplifies state and side effect management in modern React.

**Example:**
 
### Conditional Rendering
- **What:** Showing different UI based on state or props.
- **In this project:** Used for loading spinners, showing/hiding modals, toggling between sign-in/sign-up forms, etc.
- **If missing:** UI would be static and not respond to user actions.
- **Why important:** Makes the app interactive and user-friendly.

**Example from `AuthPage.jsx`:**
```js
{isSignUp ? <SignUpForm /> : <SignInForm />}
```

### Lists & Keys
- **What:** Rendering lists of elements using `.map()` and providing a unique `key` prop.
- **In this project:** Used to render product lists, categories, best deals, etc.
- **If missing:** Can't efficiently render dynamic lists; React can't track changes.
- **Why important:** Enables efficient, dynamic rendering of collections.

**Example:**


### Forms & Events
- **What:** Handling user input and form submissions.
- **In this project:** Used for search bars, login/signup forms, address forms, etc.
- **If missing:** No way to interact with the app.
- **Why important:** Enables user interaction and data entry.

**Example from `AuthPage.jsx`:**
```js
<form onSubmit={handleSignIn}>
  <input ... onChange={e => setSignInData({ ...signInData, email: e.target.value })} />
</form>
```

---

## 2. Routing & Navigation

### What is Routing?
Routing lets you show different pages/components based on the URL, making your app feel like a real website.

**In this project:**
- Uses `react-router-dom` for client-side routing.
- Main routes are defined in `App.jsx`:
  - `/` → `LandingPage`
  - `/auth` → `AuthPage`
  - `/dashboard` → `ComparelyDashboard` (protected)
  - `/products` → `ProductListingPage`
  - `/profile` → `ProfilePage`
  - `/category/:categoryName` → `CategoryPage`

**If missing:**
- All content would be on one page; no navigation between features.

**Why important:**
- Enables multi-page app experience, deep linking, and better user flow.

**Example from `App.jsx`:**
```js
<Router>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<LandingPage user={user} />} />
    <Route path="/auth" element={<AuthPage />} />
    <Route path="/dashboard" element={<PrivateRoute user={user}><ComparelyDashboard /></PrivateRoute>} />
    ...
  </Routes>
</Router>
```

**PrivateRoute:**
- Protects routes that require authentication.
- If user is not logged in, redirects to `/auth`.

**Interview Q:**
- Q: How do you protect a route in React?
- A: Use a wrapper component (like `PrivateRoute`) that checks authentication and redirects if not logged in.

---

## 3. Authentication (Firebase)

### What is Authentication?
Authentication verifies a user's identity, allowing access to protected features.

**In this project:**
- Uses Firebase for email/password authentication.
- `firebase.js` sets up Firebase.
- `AuthPage.jsx` handles sign-in and sign-up.
- `App.jsx` uses `onAuthStateChanged` to track login state.

**If missing:**
- Anyone could access private pages; no user accounts.

**Why important:**
- Protects user data and personalizes the app.

**Example from `AuthPage.jsx`:**
```js
await signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, signInData.email, signInData.password);
```

**Interview Q:**
- Q: How do you implement authentication in React?
- A: Use a service like Firebase, manage auth state, and protect routes.

## 4. Data Fetching & State Management

### Fetching Data
- **What:** Loading data from a server or file.
- **In this project:**
  - Products are loaded from `/data/products.json` using `fetch` in `useEffect`.
  - Used in `LandingPage.jsx`, `ComparelyDashboard.jsx`, `ProductListingPage.jsx`, `CategoryPage.jsx`.
- **If missing:**
  - No products would be displayed; app would be empty.
- **Why important:**
  - Dynamic, real data is essential for a useful app.

**Example:**
```js
useEffect(() => {
  fetch("/data/products.json")
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => setProducts(data));
}, []);
```

### State Management
- **What:** Keeping track of data that changes (e.g., user, products, search input).
- **In this project:**
  - `useState` for local state in each component.
  - State is passed as props when needed.
- **If missing:**
  - UI would not update when data changes.
- **Why important:**
  - Enables interactive, dynamic UIs.

---

## 5. Component Communication (Props, State, Parent-Child)

### Props
- **What:** Data passed from parent to child.
- **In this project:**
  - `LandingPage` receives `user` prop from `App.jsx`.
  - `CategoryCard` receives `title` and `image` props.
- **If missing:**
  - Components would be static and not reusable.
- **Why important:**
  - Enables flexible, dynamic UIs.

### Lifting State Up
- **What:** Moving state to a common parent so multiple children can access or update it.
- **In this project:**
  - Not heavily used, but could be applied for things like cart management.
- **If missing:**
  - Harder to share data between components.

## 6. CSS & Styling (with Responsive Design)

### How CSS is Organized
- Each major component has its own CSS file (e.g., `ComparelyDashboard.css`, `LandingPage.css`, etc.).
- Global styles in `index.css` and `App.css`.
- Images and assets in `src/assets/`.

### Example: `ComparelyDashboard.css`
- Styles the dashboard, navbar, category bar, cards, etc.
- Uses modern CSS (flex, grid, box-shadow, border-radius).
- Responsive design with media queries for different screen sizes.

**Example:**
```css
.main-navbar {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
  background: #fff;
  padding: 1.1rem 2.5rem;
  box-shadow: 0 1px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  z-index: 50;
}

@media (max-width: 900px) {
  .main-navbar {
    padding-left: 0.8rem;
    padding-right: 0.8rem;
  }
}
```

### Responsive Design
- Uses media queries to adjust layout for tablets and phones.
- Grid and flex layouts adapt to screen size.
- Ensures app looks good on all devices.

**If CSS was missing:**
- App would be unstyled, hard to use, and not responsive.

**Interview Q:**
- Q: How do you make a React app responsive?
- A: Use CSS media queries, flexible layouts (flex/grid), and test on different screen sizes.
